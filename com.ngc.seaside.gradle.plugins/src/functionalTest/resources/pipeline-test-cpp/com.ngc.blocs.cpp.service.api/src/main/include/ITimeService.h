   /*! \brief ITimeService is an interface for obtaining current time 
   and setting alarms, a type of event that is set to occur at a specific clock time

   ITimeService encapsulates two conceptual clocks that represent "real world time"
   and "application time".  Generally speaking, clients of the ITimeService should be 
   using "application time".  Application time's relationship to real-world time
   is defined in implementations of ITimeService.  Application time may be
   in lock-step with real-world time, offset from real-world time, scaled from
   real world time (faster or slower), or they may be completely unrelated.
